# LLDGPS

As discussed i have focused on only two basic calls:

1) login
2) getCurrentPosition

To start with the data flow for this two API please go by DeviceController class.

Feel free to reach out ot me in case of any information is required from my end.

I have assumed as i am going to use spring framework.
